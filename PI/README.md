#  🟨Event hall "San Jorge"🟦

As my Final Assignment, I decided to create a code for the family business. My parents do not use technology to enhace productivity, hence I think it would be  a useful tool for them. It will serve to introduce them using data-base program. 
This program will book reservations in an event hall divided in two sections: “Exterior con alberca” and “Interior”. The purpose of the program is to save in a ‘.txt’ file the reservation's data: date, client profile and extra services. There is going be and option to save information depending on client's reserved location
 

### How i implemante the code❓

   There program will have the next functionalities:
 
1. Add dates reserved
     -The code asks which section is going to be used and request information of the event (client’s name, date and hired services). If the registered date was already booked, the code would reject  the information added and return a text explaining that day is already reserved.

2. Consult dates reserved
     -The program needs at least one event registered within each category to enable this function. The program is going to give a list of all the events reserved depending on the site required.

3. Eliminate dates reserved
     -The "date" list is used for this function. If an event is cancelled or the client do not pay on time, the program enables the option to eliminate a booked date. This function would ask for the specific line referred to the event going to removed it.

## Instructions for the code 📌

1. Create files 'Exterior.txt' and 'Interior.txt' : (The program is able to create them, but i do not found the problem)
2. Register an event on each location to watch the catalogue of reserved events
3. Use _ as space if you want to add a name as 'Fiesta_de_Jose'
4. You can add two events in the same date, just if the locations are different. If you try to add an event at the same location and times, the program would reject the information (that is the main purpose of the code)
