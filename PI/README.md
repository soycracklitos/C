# Agenda de Eventos San Jorge



### What is the purpose of the code?

- My family has a ballroom, so i've decided to create a code to book events with the knowledge of the course. The place has two areas to celebrate parties.
A close saloon and an exterior with a pool


  - The main idea is:
    -  Reserve dates  
    -  View dates reserved
    -  

### How i implemante the code?
