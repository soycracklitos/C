#  🟨Agenda de Eventos San Jorge🟦

As my Final Assignment, I have decided to create a code for the family business. My parents do not use technology to improve their productivity, so I think this is a good gift to them, as well as to introduce them to use this type of programs. 
This code is going to be used for an event hall divided in two sections: “Exterior con alberca” and “Interior”. The purpose of the code is to save in a ‘.txt’ file data such as the reservation date, client profile and hired services. There is going be and option to save information depending on which zone the event will take place.
 

### How i implemante the code❓

   There are three main options of code:
 
1. Add dates reserved
     -The code asks which site is going to be used and request information of the event (client’s name, date and hired services). If the registered date was already booked, the code rejects the information added and respond with a text explaining that day is already reserved.

2. Consult dates reserved
     -The code needs at least one event registered within each category to active this function. The code is going to give a list of all the events reserved depending on the site required.

3. Eliminate dates reserved
     -The "date" list is used for this function. If an event is cancelled or the client did not pay on time, it can be possible to eliminate a booked date. This function would ask for the specific line referred to the event eliminate it.
